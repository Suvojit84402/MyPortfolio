                A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently. In this online course, considering the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. I learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This help me to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. I also learn typical use cases for these data structures.

            <p>
                Beginning with an explanation of how internet servers and clients work together to deliver applications to users, this course then takes me through the context for application development in the Cloud, introducing front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.
                Then focusing on the languages needed for front-end development, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Finally, I discover tools that help you to store your projects and keep track of changes made to project files, such as Git and GitHub.
